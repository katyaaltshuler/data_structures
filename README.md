# Data Structures exercise


Imagine having some data that tends to be big-scale
(e.g. records of imported goods and customs duties paid in logistic company).

The most **simple and least effective** way (in terms of occupying RAM) of storing complex/nested data structures:
using **List** and **Dict** without specifying any expected data type.
<p>Current exercise shows clearly how you can <b>increase efficiency and reduce the amount of memory occupied</b> when storing complex data structures 
just using DataClasses and NamedTuple: from 15.2 MB to only 4.2 MB in current example.</p>
